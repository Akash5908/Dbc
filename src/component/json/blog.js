        "review": "What an amazing way to see Old Delhi. Jeswin was an energetic,knowledgeable guide who made the day fun for everyone (even though it poured rain for the majority of the ride!). When the trip was over, they invited us back to the office to dry off and some members of our group ended up talking for almost an hour. True hospitality and an eye opening experience. Thanks again."

We started by driving out of Delhi for two hours, followed by a breakfast of delicious tandoor-cooked parathas. Then we started cycling through the villages, with explanations about Krishna’s life by our knowledgeable guides."

Yet if you do and learn to let go, you start to discover the beauty of Delhi. Himanshu is amazing! His love for the city shines through him that it was impossible for it not to start rubbing on you as well."
